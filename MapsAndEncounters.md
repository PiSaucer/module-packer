# Tutorial: Including Maps and Encounters

## Maps
1. Create your map in EncounterPlus as you normally would. It can be created in a temporary module or campaign.
2. View the Map in EncounterPlus's Library View.
3. Click the "..." icon and choose "Export". Save the zip file somewhere.

4. In your Module's directory, create a subfolder for maps (I named mine "Maps").
5. Create a `Group.yaml` file for this directory and set `include-in` to `files` and `copy-files` to `false` so a Group is not created and the raw zip files are not included in your module.
6. Copy the map's zip file into this folder.
7. In your `Module.yaml` file, create a property named `maps`. Then, as a children maps, create individual elements for each map. Each element must contain a "path" property pointing to the map's `.zip` file. Optionally, each element can also specify a `parent`, and `order`, and a `slug` property. These specify the parent the map will be nested under, the order it will show up under its parent, and its slug link respectively.

Here is an example `Module.yaml` file with a couple of maps defined
```Markdown
name: My Module
slug: my-module
description: A campaign setting.
category: adventure
maps:
  - path: Maps/my-first-map.zip
    order: 2
    parent: my-adventure-part-1
    slug: my-first-map
  - path: Maps/my-second-map.zip
    order: 5
    parent: my-adventure-part-1
    slug: my-second-map
```

## Encounters
Encounters are added in a way very similar to maps.

1. Create your encounter in EncounterPlus as your normally would - this includes creating your Encounter as part of a loaded map so monsters are positioned correctly.
2. View the Encounter in EncounterPlus's Library View.
3. Click the "..." icon and choose "Export". Save the zip file somewhere.

4. In your Module's directory, create a subfolder for maps (I named mine "Encounters").
5. Create a `Group.yaml` file for this directory and set `include-in` to `files` and `copy-files` to `false` so a Group is not created and the raw zip files are not included in your module.
6. Copy the encounter's zip file into this folder.
7. In your `Module.yaml` file, create a property named `encounters`. Then, as children of encounters, create individual elements for each encounter. Each element must contain a "path" property pointing to the encounter's `.zip` file. Optionally, each element can also specify a `parent`, and `order`, and a `slug` property. These specify the parent the encounter will be nested under, the order it will show up under its parent, and its slug link respectively.

Here is an example `Module.yaml` file with a couple of encounters defined after the maps. Note that you may nest encounters under maps as demonstrated.
```Markdown
name: My Module
slug: my-module
description: A campaign setting.
category: adventure
maps:
  - path: Maps/my-first-map.zip
    order: 2
    parent: my-adventure-part-1
    slug: my-first-map
  - path: Maps/my-second-map.zip
    order: 5
    parent: my-adventure-part-1
    slug: my-second-map
encounters:
  - path: Encounters/my-first-encounter.zip
    order: 1
    parent: my-first-map
    slug: my-first-encounter
  - path: Encounters/my-second-encounter.zip
    order: 2
    parent: my-first-map
    slug: my-second-encounter
```
